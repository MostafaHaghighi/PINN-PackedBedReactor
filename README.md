# PINN-PackedBedReactor
This repository provides a research-grade Python implementation of a CO₂ methanation plug flow reactor (PFR) for fixed-bed catalytic systems. The model is developed using a physics-informed formulation, where governing mass balances, reaction kinetics, and thermodynamic constraints are explicitly encoded.
